# StudyAdvisor HUD 🧠🚀

An elite, two-page productivity system that separates **Planning** from **Deep Focus**.

## 🎮 How it Works
1. **Command Center (`index.html`)**: Map out your subjects and chapters. Set your intent.
2. **Focus HUD (`focus.html`)**: Zero-distraction execution mode.
3. **Productivity Scoring**: A real-time algorithm that tracks focus volume, discipline, and intent while penalizing pauses.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Upload these files to a GitHub Repository.
2. Go to **Settings > Pages**.
3. Set the source to the `main` branch and click **Save**.
4. Your HUD is now live at `https://yourusername.github.io/reponame`.

## 🧠 The Scoring Logic
* **Focus Volume**: Rewards up to 4 hours of daily deep work.
* **Discipline**: Ratio of sessions started vs. completed.
* **Intent Bonus**: Extra points for selecting a specific chapter before working.
* **Pause Penalty**: Deducts points for every time you break focus.
